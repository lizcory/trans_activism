            <p>Only three months into 2021, US legislators across 33 states<a href = "https://www.advocate.com/transgender/2021/3/12/record-number-anti-trans-bills-introduced-states-year" >
                have introduced</a> an historic
                number of bills threatening the rights and wellbeing of transgender people — 93, as of 
                this writing. During the 2020 session, 79 anti-transgender bills 
                were filed, the previous record-high. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Most of the bills proposed this year specifically <a href = https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/29/arkansas-transgender-healthcare-ban-minors>target trans children</a>.
                Several seek to criminalize gender-affirming healthcare for youth, defying scientific <a href = "https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/new-arkansas-law-and-similar-bills-endanger-transgender-youth-research-shows/">
                research</a> that demonstrates the safety and lifesaving capacity of medical interventions, such as puberty-blocking hormones, for trans youth.
                Many other bills aim to bar trans kids from participating in sports with their cisgender peers — this would mean refusing already vulnerable students a crucial

                associated with better mental health outcomes.

                <br>
                <br>

                The enormity of this discriminatory policy has ignited public discourse, and calls for action have 
                resounded on Twitter under the hashtag #TransRightsAreHumanRights.

            <p> The kinds of anti-transgender bills introduced has shifted considerably over the past four years. In 2018 and 2019 bills 
                about bathroom use were more common, while legislation in 2020 and 2021 largely focuses on 
                barring transgender children from participating in sports and receiving gender-affirming healthcare.

                Tweets were gathered from a full archive search of the Twitter API v2. We queried tweets from 1/01/20 to 3/26/21 that 
                included "#TransRightsAreHumanRights" and filtered for those containing place information at the city level.
                Coordinates for each tweet were calculated by first averaging the bounding box coordinates marking the city
                and then applying a random jitter to avoid point overlap.
                
                Anti-trans bill information was gathered from the ACLU's page on <a href = https://www.aclu.org/legislation-affecting-lgbt-rights-across-country>Legislation Affecting LGBTQ Rights Across the Country</a>
